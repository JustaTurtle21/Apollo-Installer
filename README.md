# Apollo-Installer
This installer was made by me to do the boring task of installing Arch linux.
The reason I made it is to install Arch quickly because I play around with
VMs a lot. I would recommend you to edit the scripts as they are made to my
liking and beginners please do not use this as you have to understand what to install
